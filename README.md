# üè´ Student Departure System (SDS)

A terminal-based Python application that simulates a Student Departure (Exeat) System for universities. Built using Python basics, this project allows students to request exeats, the dean to approve or deny them, and security to track students currently off campus ‚Äî all through a menu-driven system.
